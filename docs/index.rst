Documentation
=============

|webcore| is a collection of django apps, utilities and libraries that were originally created and maintained internally at Motion MÃ©dia. We are now proud to open source it for the django community.

The open source version is still in its infancy (not production ready!), but we hope it will flourish and gain maturity.
